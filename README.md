# Tree Structure to Rectangles Visualization

## Project Overview
This project is a Java-based algorithm visualization tool that converts a tree data structure into a rectangular representation. The project showcases a custom algorithm that traverses and visualizes hierarchical data by converting each node in the tree to a rectangle. This is helpful in understanding tree structures and their relationships in a clear, visual format.

## Features
- **Tree Traversal**: Recursively traverses the tree structure.
- **Visual Representation**: Converts each node and its children into nested rectangles.
- **Customizable Tree**: Easily modify and input your own tree structures for visualization.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Provides a user-friendly interface to visualize the rectangles in real-time.

## Technology Stack
- **Java**: The core programming language used to implement the algorithm.
- **Swing**: Used for the graphical user interface and visualization.
- **CSV Parsing**: Supports importing tree structures from CSV files.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8 or higher).
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for running and editing the project.

### Running the Project
1. Clone the repository:
